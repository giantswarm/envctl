# PRD: The `envctl` Generic Orchestration Platform

<context>
This document outlines the final architecture for `envctl`, transforming it from a Kubernetes-centric tool into a truly generic orchestration platform. The core principle is the complete removal of hardcoded concepts like "clusters" and "port-forwards" from the `envctl` core. These will be reimplemented as user-defined **Capabilities**.

The key enabling mechanism for this decoupling is the introduction of **Precondition Workflows** for `envctl`'s managed services.

# Core Architecture: Generic Orchestrator + Capabilities

## 1. The Generic Core Orchestrator
The `Orchestrator` will be refactored to be completely domain-agnostic.
- Its only responsibility is to manage a list of generic `Service` definitions from `envctl.yaml`. A `Service` is just a process to run (local command or container).
- All hardcoded dependency logic related to clusters and port-forwards will be **removed**.
- Instead, a `Service` definition can now include a `preconditionWorkflow`. Before starting the service, the orchestrator executes this workflow. If it fails, the service is not started.
- The orchestrator will expose its service management actions through clearly namespaced MCP tools (using the `core_*` prefix).

## 2. The User-Defined Capability Layer
- Concepts like `cluster` and `portforward` are no longer native to `envctl`. They are implemented as default `*.capability.yaml` files that ship with the application.
- These capability files define the high-level API (e.g., `api_cluster_connect`, `api_portforward_create`).
- These capabilities are fulfilled by backend MCP servers (e.g., a minimal `mcp-server-kubectl`).

## 3. The New Decoupled Flow
A service like a Prometheus MCP server that needs a connection is now defined like this in `envctl.yaml`:
```yaml
mcpServers:
  - name: prometheus
    type: container
    image: "prom/prometheus"
    # This workflow runs BEFORE the container is started.
    preconditionWorkflow:
      steps:
        - id: connect_to_cluster
          tool: api_cluster_connect
          args: { name: "my-obs-cluster" }
        - id: forward_prometheus_port
          tool: api_portforward_create
          args:
            cluster_uri: "{{ steps.connect_to_cluster.result.uri }}"
            namespace: "monitoring"
            service: "prometheus-k8s"
            port: "9090"
          store: prometheus_endpoint
    # The result of the workflow can be injected into the service.
    env:
      PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT: "{{ workflow.result.prometheus_endpoint }}"
```

# Tool Naming Convention

To provide clarity and avoid conflicts, envctl will use the following tool naming prefixes:
- `core_*` - Core orchestrator tools for service management (e.g., `core_service_start`, `core_service_status`)
- `workflow_*` - Workflow management tools (e.g., `workflow_list`, `workflow_execute`)
- `api_*` - High-level capability operations (e.g., `api_cluster_connect`, `api_portforward_create`)
- Configurable prefix (default `x_`) - For external MCP server tools to avoid conflicts

# Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Generic Orchestrator & Tool Naming
- **Goal**: Decouple the orchestrator from Kubernetes and port-forwarding, establish clear tool naming conventions.
- **Tasks**:
    - Implement the `preconditionWorkflow` feature in the `Service` definition and the orchestrator.
    - Update the aggregator to use the new tool naming convention (`core_*`, `workflow_*`, `api_*`).
    - **Delete** the hardcoded dependency graph logic (`internal/orchestrator/orchestrator_deps.go`).
    - **Delete** the `internal/kube` and `internal/portforwarding` packages entirely.
    - **Delete** `ClusterDefinition` and `PortForwardDefinition` from `internal/config/types.go`.
    - Modify the `envctl connect` command to remove its cluster-specific parameters.

## Phase 2: The Default Capabilities
- **Goal**: Re-implement the lost functionality as user-space capabilities.
- **Tasks**:
    - Create a new, minimal `mcp-server-kubectl` that provides basic tools for `kubectl context`, `kubectl port-forward`, etc.
    - Create the default `cluster.capability.yaml` file.
    - Create the default `portforward.capability.yaml` file.
    - Ensure these capabilities expose the `api_cluster_*` and `api_portforward_*` tools.

## Phase 3: Unification and TUI
- **Goal**: Ensure the user experience is seamless.
- **Tasks**:
    - Update the TUI to use the new `api_*` tools for all its operations.
    - Provide default `envctl.yaml` examples that show users how to compose precondition workflows.
