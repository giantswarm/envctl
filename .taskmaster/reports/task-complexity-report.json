      "taskTitle": "Phase 1: Core Resource Framework",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the core framework task into granular steps: (1) Analyze and document the old 'capability' package structure, (2) Plan and execute the refactor to 'resource', (3) Design new resource data structures, (4) Implement and test the YAML loader, (5) Develop the ResourceRegistry with CRUD methods, (6) Write comprehensive unit and integration tests.",
      "reasoning": "This task is foundational and involves significant refactoring, new data structure design, and loader implementation. It requires careful planning, coordination, and thorough testing, making it complex and justifying further breakdown into more granular subtasks."

      "taskId": 34,
      "taskTitle": "Phase 2: Implement the `service` Resource",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by identifying: (1) Define the 'service_resource.yaml' schema, (2) Map orchestrator processes to resource instances, (3) Update the Orchestrator to register services, (4) Implement status synchronization between orchestrator and registry, (5) Develop and run unit/integration tests.",
      "reasoning": "This task connects existing orchestrator logic to the new resource model, requiring schema design, mapping logic, registry updates, and robust testing. The integration aspect and need for synchronization increase its complexity."
    },

      "taskId": 35,
      "taskTitle": "Phase 3: Implement the `cluster` Resource",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose this task into: (1) Define 'cluster_resource.yaml', (2) Implement provider discovery integration, (3) Map discovery results to cluster resources, (4) Bind standard operations to provider tools, (5) Handle error and edge cases, (6) Develop integration tests with mock providers.",
      "reasoning": "This is the first external-facing resource, involving provider integration, discovery, mapping, and operation binding. The need to handle external systems and ensure robust operation increases both complexity and the need for detailed subtasks."

      "taskId": 36,
      "taskTitle": "Phase 4: The Unified Resource API",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Design API endpoints for resource listing and invocation, (2) Implement Aggregator logic for querying the registry, (3) Develop the universal 'x_resource_invoke' tool, (4) Ensure correct execution and state updates, (5) Handle error cases and concurrency, (6) Write end-to-end tests, (7) Document API usage.",
      "reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the need for robust API design, universal operation handling, concurrency, and end-to-end integration. It is the linchpin for exposing the new model to clients, requiring careful breakdown."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Refactor TUI to use unified resource browser, (2) Update views to consume new API, (3) Rewrite architecture and developer documentation, (4) Perform manual and user acceptance testing.",
      "reasoning": "While less technically complex than backend phases, this task involves significant UI refactoring and comprehensive documentation updates. It requires coordination between frontend and documentation efforts, justifying several subtasks."

      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the Domain Resource Abstraction Layer into subtasks such as: designing the resource schema, implementing the YAML loader, building the parser, managing resource registration, integrating with provider tool detection, and writing unit/integration tests.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves designing and implementing a core extensibility framework, including file parsing, dynamic resource management, and integration with provider tools. The need for robust error handling, extensibility, and comprehensive testing increases both the technical and architectural complexity, warranting a high score and multiple subtasks."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the implementation of the `cluster` Domain Resource into subtasks such as: defining the `cluster.resource.yaml` schema, implementing the resource logic, mapping operations to Core Resources, integrating with the abstraction layer, and developing E2E tests.",
      "reasoning": "This task is the first real-world use of the abstraction layer and requires bridging user-facing operations with underlying system workflows. While it builds on the previous phase, it introduces orchestration logic and comprehensive E2E testing, making it moderately complex and suitable for several subtasks."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose the API and TUI unification into subtasks such as: refactoring the API for resource-centric operations, updating the TUI to use the unified API, designing new views/modes for Core vs. Domain resources, integrating the `x_resource_invoke` tool, manual UX testing, and automated E2E test development.",
      "reasoning": "This phase requires significant refactoring of both backend and frontend components to ensure a consistent user experience and a single entry point for resource operations. The need to coordinate API changes, UI updates, and comprehensive testing increases the complexity and justifies multiple subtasks."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the implementation of default capabilities by detailing the steps to design, develop, and test the new mcp-server-kubectl, create and validate capability definition files, ensure integration with the generic orchestrator, and provide user documentation and migration guides.",
      "reasoning": "This phase requires re-implementing critical functionality in a new, decoupled form, including building a new server, defining workflows, and ensuring seamless integration. While less risky than Phase 1, it still involves multiple moving parts, cross-component coordination, and user-facing changes, justifying a moderate-to-high complexity and need for additional subtasks."

      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose the final unification phase into updating the TUI to use the new capability API, rewriting documentation, performing user acceptance testing, and gathering feedback for further improvements.",
      "reasoning": "This phase is primarily focused on updating interfaces and documentation to match the new architecture. While important for usability, it is less technically complex than the previous phases, but still requires coordination between UI, documentation, and QA, meriting a moderate complexity score and several subtasks."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the tool naming convention updates into specific implementation steps for each tool category, including code changes, testing, and validation of the new naming structure.",
      "reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to systematic refactoring across multiple tool categories. Already well-decomposed with 7 subtasks covering all naming convention updates. Each subtask is focused and manageable."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the capability system refactoring to include detailed implementation steps for package renaming, tool generation updates, workflow integration, testing, and validation of the new api_ prefix system.",
      "reasoning": "Medium complexity involving package restructuring and API changes. Currently has 3 subtasks but needs expansion to cover testing, validation, and potential integration issues with the new core_service_* tools."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the TUI and cluster capability updates into specific tasks covering configuration file updates, TUI interface modifications, user experience testing, and end-to-end validation of the new namespaced API.",
      "reasoning": "Medium-low complexity as it's primarily integration work building on previous phases. Currently has no subtasks but needs decomposition to cover cluster capability updates, TUI modifications, and user acceptance testing."

      "taskTitle": "Phase 1: Generic Orchestrator",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Further decompose the generic orchestrator implementation by breaking down complex subtasks like 'Refactor Orchestrator Functions' and 'Remove Hardcoded Dependencies' into more granular, actionable steps with clear deliverables.",
      "reasoning": "Very high complexity involving major architectural changes, code removal, and system decoupling. Already has 8 well-structured subtasks, but some are still quite large and could benefit from further breakdown, especially the refactoring and dependency removal tasks."
