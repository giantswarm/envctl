			"taskTitle": "Phase 1: Core Resource Framework",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the core framework task into granular steps: (1) Analyze and document the old 'capability' package structure, (2) Plan and execute the refactor to 'resource', (3) Design new resource data structures, (4) Implement and test the YAML loader, (5) Develop the ResourceRegistry with CRUD methods, (6) Write comprehensive unit and integration tests.",
			"reasoning": "This task is foundational and involves significant refactoring, new data structure design, and loader implementation. It requires careful planning, coordination, and thorough testing, making it complex and justifying further breakdown into more granular subtasks."

			"taskId": 34,
			"taskTitle": "Phase 2: Implement the `service` Resource",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by identifying: (1) Define the 'service_resource.yaml' schema, (2) Map orchestrator processes to resource instances, (3) Update the Orchestrator to register services, (4) Implement status synchronization between orchestrator and registry, (5) Develop and run unit/integration tests.",
			"reasoning": "This task connects existing orchestrator logic to the new resource model, requiring schema design, mapping logic, registry updates, and robust testing. The integration aspect and need for synchronization increase its complexity."

			"reasoning": "This phase requires significant refactoring of both backend and frontend components to ensure a consistent user experience and a single entry point for resource operations. The need to coordinate API changes, UI updates, and comprehensive testing increases the complexity and justifies multiple subtasks."
