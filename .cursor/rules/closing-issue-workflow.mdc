When closing an issue:

1. Confirm with the user that the issue is ready to be closed.
2. Use the `update_issue` tool to change the state of the issue to 'closed'. Make sure to specify the `owner` as `giantswarm`, `repo` as `envctl`, and the correct `issue_number`.
3. Briefly mention the issue (title and number) that was closed.
