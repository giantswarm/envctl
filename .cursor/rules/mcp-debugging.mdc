- **Debugging envctl via mcp-debug**
  - mcp-debug provides core debugging tools to test and explore the functionality of envctl exposed in its aggregated MCP server. 
  - Use mcp-debug tools as the primary debugging interface rather than manual inspection

- **mcp-debug Tools**
  - mcp_mcp-debug_list_tools: list all the tools exposed by the aggregated mcp server
  - mcp_mcp-debug_describe_tool: describe a tool exposed by the aggregated mcp server
  - mcp_mcp-debugcall_tool: execute a tool exposed by the aggregated mcp server

- **Aggregated MCP server**
  - The aggregated MCP server is exposed by envctl. This is the main subject of development and debugging here.
  - The aggregated MCP server exposes tools via the model-context-protocol that you can explore via mcp-debug
  - The main functionality of envctl is exposed through the tools that are prefixed with `core_*`
  - The aggregated MCP server can be compiled and restarted via `./scripts/dev-restart.sh`

- **Debugging Examples**
  - 1. Verify All Services Are Running: 
    Start by checking the overall health of the system:
    ```
    mcp_mcp-debug_call_tool(name="core_service_list", arguments={})
    ```
  - 2. Check MCP Server Registration:
    Verify that all expected MCP servers are properly registered with the aggregator:
    ```
    mcp_mcp-debug_call_tool(name="core_mcpserver_list", arguments={})
    ```
  - 3. If a service shows as unhealthy:
      1. Check its detailed status: `core_service_status`
      2. Try restarting it: `core_service_restart`
      3. Check if its MCP client is attached in the service list
  - 4. Workflow validation fails:
    - Use `core_workflow_validate` to check syntax
    - Ensure tool names exist (check with `mcp_mcp-debug_list_tools`)
    - Verify argument schemas match the tool requirements

- **Important Notes**
  - The tools with the prefix `x_` are coming from the MCP servers that are managed by envctl and then aggregated in its own MCP server. Please don't try to fix them. They are separate projects. 
  - Tool names from individual MCP servers get prefixed like this `x_kubernetes_*` for the kubernetes MCP server and `x_prometheus_*`  for the prometheus MCP server

- **Debugging Approach**
  - Phase 1: System Health Verification
    ```
    mcp_mcp-debug_call_tool(name="core_mcpserver_list", arguments={})
    mcp_mcp-debug_call_tool(name="core_serviceclass_list", arguments={})
    mcp_mcp-debug_call_tool(name="core_workflow_list", arguments={})
    mcp_mcp-debug_call_tool(name="core_capability_list", arguments={})
    mcp_mcp-debug_call_tool(name="core_service_list", arguments={})
    ```
    Key Checks:
    - All MCP servers services show `"health": "Healthy"` and `"state": "Running"`
    - ServiceClasses show `"available": true`
    - No `missingTools` in ServiceClass definitions
  - ServiceClass-Specific Testing
    ```
    # Test specific ServiceClass availability
    mcp_mcp-debug_call_tool(name="core_serviceclass_available", arguments={"name": "<serviceclass-name>"})

    # Test instantiation with safe parameters
    mcp_mcp-debug_call_tool(name="core_service_create", arguments={
    "serviceClassName": "<name>",
    "label": "debug-test",
    "parameters": {...}
    })
    ```
  - Dependency Verification
    ```
    # Test underlying tools directly
    mcp_mcp-debug_call_tool(name="<required-tool>", arguments={...})

    # Verify connectivity to external systems
    ```
  - Service Recovery
    ```
    # Restart failed services
    mcp_mcp-debug_call_tool(name="core_service_restart", arguments={"label": "<service-name>"})

    # Check detailed status
    mcp_mcp-debug_call_tool(name="core_service_status", arguments={"label": "<service-name>"})
    ```
  - Service Instance Management
    ```
    # List and clean up test instances
    mcp_mcp-debug_call_tool(name="core_service_list", arguments={})
    mcp_mcp-debug_call_tool(name="core_service_delete", arguments={"instanceId": "debug-test"})
    ```

- **Tool Missing Errors**
  - **Pattern:** `missingTools` array not empty in ServiceClass list
  - **Action:** Check MCP server health, restart if needed
  - **Root Cause:** Usually failed MCP server initialization

- **Cleanup Protocol**
  - **✅ DO:** Always clean up test ServiceClasses, Workflows, Capabilities, MCP servers and Services after debugging
  - **✅ DO:** Use unique, identifiable labels for test instances (e.g., "debug-test-<timestamp>")
  - **❌ DON'T:** Leave test ServiceClasses, Workflows, Capabilities, MCP servers and Services

- **When Debugging ServiceClasses, Workflows, Capabilities, MCP servers and Services**
  - Document the issue in the debugging session
  - Update the debugging workflow if new issues are discovered
  - Add specific examples to the common issues section
  - Create reproduction steps for any bugs found

- **Mandatory Workflow Adherence**
  - NEVER skip health verification when debugging
  - ALWAYS clean up test instances after debugging sessions
  - DOCUMENT new issues in the documentation
  - USE mcp-debug tools as the primary debugging interface
  - FOLLOW a systematic approach rather than ad-hoc investigation
