# K8s State Management Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the K8s state management in envctl to eliminate redundancy and consolidate all state tracking into the central StateStore.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Removed Redundant K8s State Management
- **Deleted Files:**
  - `internal/state/k8s_state.go` - The separate K8s state manager
  - `internal/state/k8s_state_test.go` - Associated tests
  - `internal/tui/controller/health_update_test.go` - Tests for removed health update handler

### 2. Enhanced ManagedServiceUpdate
- Added `K8sHealthData` struct to carry K8s-specific health information:
  ```go
  type K8sHealthData struct {
      ReadyNodes int
      TotalNodes int
      IsMC       bool
  }
  ```
- Added `K8sHealth *K8sHealthData` field to `ManagedServiceUpdate`
- Added `WithK8sHealth()` builder method

### 3. Removed ReportHealth Infrastructure
- Removed `ReportHealth()` method from `ServiceReporter` interface
- Removed `HealthStatusUpdate` and `HealthStatusMsg` types
- Removed `handleHealthStatusMsg()` from TUI controller
- Updated all reporter implementations to remove ReportHealth

### 4. Updated K8s Service Reporting
- Modified `k8s_service.go` to include health data in regular `Report()` calls
- K8s health information now flows through the same channel as all other service updates
- Added `reportStateWithHealth()` method to handle health data inclusion

### 5. Updated TUI State Reconciliation
- Modified `ReconcileState()` in TUI model to extract K8s health data from StateStore
- Removed dependency on K8sStateManager
- Cluster health info now comes from service state snapshots with K8s health data

### 6. Updated Tests
- Removed tests that relied on HealthStatusUpdate/HealthStatusMsg
- Updated mocks to remove ReportHealth expectations
- Added GetStateStore expectations where needed
- All tests now use the unified reporting mechanism

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All service states, including K8s health, are now in the central StateStore
2. **Simplified Architecture**: Removed duplicate state tracking and redundant reporting paths
3. **Consistent API**: All services report through the same `Report()` method
4. **Better Maintainability**: Less code duplication and clearer data flow
5. **Improved Testing**: Simpler mocks and more consistent test patterns

## Key Insight
The K8s state management was indeed legacy code from before the centralized state management was implemented. By consolidating everything into the StateStore, we've made the codebase more consistent and easier to understand.

## Test Coverage Impact
- Maintained or improved test coverage for affected packages
- All existing tests continue to pass
- The refactoring did not break any functionality
