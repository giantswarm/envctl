# envctl üöÄ

Your friendly environment connector for Giant Swarm!

`envctl` is a command-line tool designed to simplify connecting your development environment, particularly [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/modelcontext/protocol) servers used in IDEs like Cursor, to Giant Swarm Kubernetes clusters and services like Prometheus.

It automates the process of logging into clusters via Teleport (`tsh`) and setting up necessary connections like port-forwarding for Prometheus (Mimir).

## Features ‚ú®

*   **Simplified Connection:** Connect to management and workload clusters with a single command.
*   **Flexible Cluster Configuration:** Define clusters with roles (observability, target, custom) and switch between them dynamically.
*   **Automatic Context Switching:** Sets your Kubernetes context correctly.
*   **Port-Forwarding Management:** 
    *   Prometheus and Grafana services (always from the Management Cluster)
    *   Alloy Metrics (from the Workload Cluster if specified, otherwise from the Management Cluster)
    *   Custom port forwards via YAML configuration
*   **Interactive Terminal UI:** View cluster status, manage port forwards, and monitor connections in a polished terminal interface.
*   **Teleport Integration:** Uses your existing `tsh` setup for Kubernetes access.
*   **Shell Completion:** Provides dynamic command-line completion for cluster names (Bash & Zsh).
*   **Service Dependency Management:** Automatically handles service dependencies and cascading operations.
*   **Health Monitoring:** Continuous health checks for all services with automatic recovery.
*   **Flexible Configuration:** Layer-based configuration system (default ‚Üí user ‚Üí project).
*   **MCP Server Support:** Run Model Context Protocol servers as local commands or Docker containers.

```

### Option 2: Build from Source

1.  Clone this repository (or ensure you are in the project directory).
2.  Build the binary:
    ```sh
    go build -o envctl .
    ```
3.  (Optional) Move the `envctl` binary to a directory in your `$PATH` (e.g., `/usr/local/bin` or `~/bin`):
    ```sh
    mv envctl /usr/local/bin/
    ```

## Usage üéÆ

The primary command is `envctl connect`:

```
envctl connect <management-cluster> [workload-cluster-shortname]
```

This command launches the interactive TUI by default, showing you real-time status of your clusters and port-forwards.

Other commands:

```
# Show current version
envctl version

# Update envctl to the latest release
envctl self-update

# Debug the MCP aggregator as a client
envctl agent

# Launch interactive REPL mode for MCP testing
envctl agent --repl

# Use the CLI mode without TUI (for scripts or CI environments)
# This mode will:
# - Log into the specified cluster(s) via tsh
# - Set the Kubernetes context
# - Start port-forwarding for configured services
# - Start configured MCP servers (if their executables are available)
# - Keep running until interrupted (Ctrl+C)
# - All services stop when envctl exits
envctl connect <management-cluster> [workload-cluster-shortname] --no-tui

# Enable debug logging for troubleshooting
envctl connect <management-cluster> --debug
```

### Agent Command

The `agent` command acts as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) client for debugging and testing:

```bash
# Basic mode - connects and monitors MCP servers
envctl agent

# Interactive REPL mode for exploring MCP capabilities
envctl agent --repl
```

**REPL Mode Features:**

The interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) mode allows you to:
- List and describe available tools, resources, and prompts
- Execute tools with JSON arguments
- Retrieve resource contents
- Get prompts with arguments
- Toggle notification display on/off
- **Tab completion** for commands, tool names, resource URIs, and prompt names
- **Command history** with arrow key navigation
- **History search** with Ctrl+R
- Persistent history across REPL sessions

**Example REPL session:**
```
MCP> list tools
Available tools (5):
  1. mcp_envctl-mcp_execute_query       - Execute a PromQL instant query
  2. mcp_envctl-mcp_execute_range_query - Execute a PromQL range query

MCP> describe tool mcp_envctl-mcp_execute_query
Tool: mcp_envctl-mcp_execute_query

The Agent REPL overlay allows you to interact with MCP servers without leaving the TUI, making it easy to test tools, inspect resources, and debug MCP connections. For detailed usage, see the [Agent REPL TUI documentation](docs/agent-repl-tui.md).

For more details on the implementation and architecture of the TUI, see the [TUI documentation](docs/tui.md).

## Service Dependencies üîó

`envctl` automatically manages dependencies between services to ensure everything starts and stops in the correct order:

### Dependency Hierarchy

```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ  K8s Connections    ‚îÇ (Foundation - no dependencies)
‚îÇ  - MC Connection    ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  - WC Connection    ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
           ‚îÇ
           ‚ñº
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ   Port Forwards     ‚îÇ (Depend on K8s connections)
‚îÇ  - mc-prometheus    ‚îÇ ‚Üí Requires MC connection
‚îÇ  - mc-grafana       ‚îÇ ‚Üí Requires MC connection  
‚îÇ  - alloy-metrics    ‚îÇ ‚Üí Requires WC or MC connection
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
           ‚îÇ
           ‚ñº
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ    MCP Servers      ‚îÇ (May depend on port forwards)
‚îÇ  - kubernetes       ‚îÇ ‚Üí Requires MC connection
‚îÇ  - prometheus       ‚îÇ ‚Üí Requires mc-prometheus port forward
‚îÇ  - grafana          ‚îÇ ‚Üí Requires mc-grafana port forward
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

### Automatic Behavior

1. **Starting Services**: Services start in dependency order - K8s connections first, then port forwards, then MCP servers
2. **Cascade Stop**: Stopping a service automatically stops all services that depend on it
3. **Health Monitoring**: If a K8s connection becomes unhealthy, all dependent services are automatically stopped
4. **Auto-Recovery**: When a K8s connection recovers, services that were stopped due to the failure are automatically restarted
5. **Restart with Dependencies**: Restarting a service ensures all its dependencies are also running

### Examples

- If you stop the `mc-prometheus` port forward, the `prometheus` MCP server will also stop
- If the MC K8s connection fails, all MC port forwards and their dependent MCP servers stop
- When restarting the `grafana` MCP server, if the `mc-grafana` port forward isn't running, it will be restarted too
- Manually stopped services won't be auto-restarted when dependencies recover

## Shell Completion üß†

`envctl` supports shell completion for cluster names.

**Setup (Zsh):**

```bash
# For Oh My Zsh
./envctl completion zsh > ~/.oh-my-zsh/completions/_envctl

# Or for standard Zsh (add to ~/.zshrc if needed: fpath=(~/.zsh/completion $fpath))
mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completion
./envctl completion zsh > ~/.zsh/completion/_envctl
exec zsh # Reload shell or run compinit
```

**Setup (Bash):**

```bash
# System-wide (requires sudo)
sudo mkdir -p /etc/bash_completion.d/
./envctl completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/envctl

# Or for current user (add to ~/.bashrc)
echo "source <(./envctl completion bash)" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc # Reload shell
```

Now you can use TAB to complete cluster names:

```bash
envctl connect myinstallation <TAB>      # Shows short names of workload clusters for myinstallation
```

## Flexible Configuration via YAML ‚öôÔ∏è

`envctl` supports a powerful YAML-based configuration system to customize its behavior, define new MCP servers, and manage port-forwarding rules. This allows you to tailor `envctl` precisely to your development needs.

### New: Flexible Cluster Configuration üöÄ

The new cluster configuration system allows you to:
- Define multiple clusters with specific roles (observability, target, custom)
- Switch between clusters dynamically through the TUI
- Have different services connect to different clusters based on their needs
- Mix and match clusters from different providers (Giant Swarm, GKE, EKS, etc.)
- Override cluster configurations for different environments (dev vs prod)

Configurations are loaded in layers (default, user-global, project-specific), with later layers overriding earlier ones. You can manage global settings, define how MCP servers are run (as local commands or containers), and specify detailed port-forwarding rules, including dynamic cluster targeting.

### Configuration Examples

See the [examples directory](docs/examples/) for:
- [Basic configuration](docs/examples/basic-config.yaml) - Minimal setup for getting started
- [Advanced configuration](docs/examples/advanced-config.yaml) - Complex scenarios with custom services

## MCP Integration Notes üí°

envctl manages MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to provide AI assistants with access to your Kubernetes clusters and services. The MCP servers are configured through envctl's YAML configuration system and can be run as:

*   **Local Commands**: Traditional executables running as local processes
*   **Docker Containers**: For isolated, reproducible environments

### Default MCP Servers

envctl comes with pre-configured MCP servers:

*   **Kubernetes** (port 8001): Provides Kubernetes API access
    - Default command: `mcp-server-kubernetes`
    - Requires: MC K8s connection
    
*   **Prometheus** (port 8002): Enables Prometheus queries
    - Default command: `mcp-server-prometheus`  
    - Requires: `mc-prometheus` port forward
    - Environment: `PROMETHEUS_URL=http://localhost:8080`
    
*   **Grafana** (port 8003): Access to Grafana dashboards
    - Default command: `mcp-server-grafana`
    - Requires: `mc-grafana` port forward
    - Environment: `GRAFANA_URL=http://localhost:3000`

### IDE Configuration

Configure your IDE (Cursor/VSCode) to connect to the MCP servers:

1. **For Cursor**: Update `.cursor/mcp_settings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "kubernetes": {
         "command": "curl",
         "args": ["-N", "http://localhost:8001/sse"]
       },
       "prometheus": {
         "command": "curl", 
         "args": ["-N", "http://localhost:8002/sse"]
       },
       "grafana": {
         "command": "curl",
         "args": ["-N", "http://localhost:8003/sse"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Restart your IDE** after starting envctl for the changes to take effect.

### Custom MCP Server Configuration

You can customize MCP servers through:

1. **YAML Configuration** (see [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md)):
   ```yaml
   mcpServers:
     - name: custom-mcp
       type: localCommand
       command: ["my-mcp-server", "--arg1", "value1"]
       proxyPort: 8004
       requiresPortForwards: ["my-service"]
       env:
         MY_VAR: "value"
   ```

2. **Environment Variables** (for quick overrides):
   ```bash
   export ENVCTL_MCP_PROMETHEUS_COMMAND="python3"
   export ENVCTL_MCP_PROMETHEUS_ARGS="-m custom_prometheus_mcp"
   export ENVCTL_MCP_PROMETHEUS_ENV_PROMETHEUS_URL="http://localhost:9090"
   
   envctl connect myinstallation
   ```

For more details on configuration options, see the [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md).
